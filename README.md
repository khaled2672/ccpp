# 🔥 Power Output Prediction & Optimization App

This project uses machine learning and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to:
- Predict power output based on ambient conditions.
- Blend ensemble models (Random Forest & XGBoost) for optimal accuracy.
- Optimize input conditions to **maximize** output power.
